# Dijkstra2StackTemplate
Template repo for Dijkstra two stack calculator
This is a standard container template repository for your assignment. Any cpp files you create related to the assignment can be pushed to this repository. There is help information for github available at https://docs.github.com/en Using github is a bit like using Cloud storage i.e. you can create and update folders , files etc. Each change you make is committed so you have an audit trail of how your file has changed. Once committed you can push your changes to the central repository.

For the assignments you will need to simply add (push and commit) files to the repository.
The following will be required for this assignment:
* Analysis document detailing your understanding of the alogrithm and what your targets are for the solution
* Design document , providing information regarding your solution i.e. interface, any diagrams and pseudocode
* Code , the java files 
* Testing , what tests you have created and how they will be run and the results
* Evaluation, did you achieve all goals set out in analysis, how could you expand the work etc
Have a look at CodeSpaces as an online editor for coding. Otherwise use intellij or other preferred editor
Use markdown for your text documents i.e analysis and design

The Dijkstra algorithm can be broadly described as follows:
* work from left to right, ignoring left side parenthesis
* push operands onto operands stack
* push operators onto operator stack
* on encountering a right parenthesis carry out the operation and push the result back onto the operand stack

### Example
(1 + ((2 + 3) * ( 4 * 5)))
should evaluate to 101.0

One key aspect of the task is to deliver a compact ( very limited in size) version of an NEA like project. Less than a page for each doc (markdown doc) should
suffice.
