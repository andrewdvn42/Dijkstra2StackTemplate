# Dijkstra2StackTemplate
Template repo for Dijkstra two stack calculator
This is a standard container template repository for your assignment. Any cpp files you create related to the assignment can be pushed to this repository. There is help information for github available at https://docs.github.com/en Using github is a bit like using Cloud storage i.e. you can create and update folders , files etc. Each change you make is committed so you have an audit trail of how your file has changed. Once committed you can push your changes to the central repository.

For the assignments you will need to simply add (push and commit) files to the repository.
The following will be required for this assignment:
* Analysis document detailing your understanding of the alogrithm and what your targets are for the solution
* Design document , providing information regarding your solution i.e. interface, any diagrams and pseudocode
* Testing , what tests you have created and how they will be run and the results
* Evaluation, did you achieve all goals set out in analysis, how could you expand the work etc
Have a look at CodeSpaces as an online editor for coding.
Use markdown for your text documents i.e analysis and design
